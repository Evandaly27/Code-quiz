## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to creat a quiz testing the knowledge on javascript. The time limit is set to 90 seconds and if you get a question wrong you are deducted 10 seconds from the timer. At the end of the game you are giving the option to add your intitials to the high scores chart. You can also view your high scores with the click of "View High Scores" 

This challenge helped me with better understanding a lot of different features of JavaScript.
